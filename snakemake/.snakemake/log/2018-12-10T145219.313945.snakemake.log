Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 1 of /Users/denis/Documents/Projects/bioinformatics-workflows/snakemake/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
mapped_reads/A.bam
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
